# Eartho Account Service

The Account Service enables users to log in with their existing accounts (Google, Facebook, Apple, etc.) while protecting their privacy through Eartho.

## Key Features
- **OAuth2 Login**: Users sign in using popular providers with OAuth2.
- **Privacy Layer**: Eartho then acts as an OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider, creating a secure, privacy-focused login across supported apps.

This service is designed to make authentication simple, familiar, and secure by adding an Eartho privacy layer over existing accounts.
