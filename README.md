  <h2>Current Challenges in User Access</h2>
</div>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Long-Term Data Ownership:</strong> 
    Using major platforms for login often means surrendering control of your data indefinitely. Users want clarity on who owns their data and how it‚Äôs stored and managed over time.
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>Fragmented Digital Identities:</strong> 
    With accounts scattered across platforms like Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, and more, managing logins becomes complex. People need a unified, secure way to access apps without losing track of their identities.
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>I don‚Äôt want to be forced to share my real identity:</strong> 
    Some users prefer to log in with minimal details, without needing to disclose personal information like email, phone number, or full name.
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>What happens to my accounts when I die?</strong> 
    Many are concerned about the future of their digital identity. They want clear control over how their accounts are managed if they‚Äôre no longer around, protecting their digital legacy.
  </li>
</ul>

</div>

<br />

<br />

## How It Works

Eartho serves as a privacy-focused layer between users and major authentication providers like Google, Facebook, and others. When users log in using Eartho, they can still choose popular sign-in options such as **Google Sign-In** or **Facebook Login**, but with a critical difference: **Big Tech companies will no longer have access to your users‚Äô login services list**.

By wrapping major sign-in services, Eartho provides the best of both worlds: the convenience of popular authentication providers and the security of true privacy for users, ensuring that no personal data leaks to third-party companies.

## Why Eartho?

In today‚Äôs digital age, privacy is paramount. Most single sign-on (SSO) providers collect data from users and track their online activity. **Eartho** solves this problem by offering a sign-in solution that ensures users‚Äô privacy remains intact.

Developers can integrate Eartho with a few lines of code and provide users with:
- Secure login options
- Control over what data they share and with whom
- A unified account management system with multiple login methods
- Protection from Big Tech tracking and surveillance

Eartho is built for developers who care about privacy and security, but don't want to compromise on ease of use.

## **Tech Stack** ‚öôÔ∏è

- **Backend**: Next.js API for authentication + Node.js to manage overall data and endpoints
- **Frontend**: Next.js (React)
- **Database**: Firestore(Should be replaced)
- **Cloud**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0, JWT

- **Auth.js**: Our one module use auth.js

Enhance your app‚Äôs authentication with Eartho. It provides a **privacy-first login** experience that integrates easily into your existing system. With Eartho, you can offer users the convenience of popular sign-in options like **Google, Facebook, Apple**, and more‚Äîwithout compromising their privacy. We ensure that **Big Tech companies can‚Äôt track your users** or use their data against you.

### **Why Add Eartho?**
- **Privacy-First Authentication**: Eartho acts as a layer of protection between your users and Big Tech, preventing data tracking while still allowing users to log in with familiar providers.
- **Multiple Authentication Options**: Give your users the freedom to log in with **Google, Facebook, Apple**, **GitHub**, or even **MetaMask**‚Äîwhile keeping their data private.
- **Easy Integration**: Eartho simplifies the development process for login, sign-up, and profile management pages. With just one line of code, you can integrate Eartho seamlessly into your app.
- **No Migration Needed**: Continue using existing authentication providers without the need to migrate users or disrupt their experience. Eartho enhances privacy while keeping everything intact.
- **Advanced Security Features**: Eartho comes with an **advanced antifraud system**, using on-device machine learning to verify user authenticity and prevent fraud.

### **How to Add Eartho**
1. **Install the SDK**  
   Begin by installing the Eartho SDK via npm or yarn:
   ```bash
   npm install @eartho/one-client-js
   ```
   or
   ```bash

   const eartho = new EarthoOne({
       client_id: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
       redirect_uri: 'YOUR_REDIRECT_URI'
   });
   ```

3. **Add Login and Logout Features**  
   Implement login and logout functionality to allow users to sign in or out securely:
   ```javascript
   function login() {
       eartho.connectWithPopup().then(result => {
           console.log('Logged in as:', result.token);
           console.log('Logged in as:', result.user);

           auth0/nextauth/firebase/supabase/clerk.loginWithCustomToken(result.token);
       }).catch(err => {
           console.error('Login failed:', err);
       });
   }

   function logout() {
       eartho.disconnect();
   }
   ```


### **Supported Platforms**

  </a>
</div>
<br />

<h2>How It Works:</h2>
Eartho wraps these providers, acting as a privacy layer, which means your login process goes through Eartho. This ensures that while the authentication provider can verify your credentials, they don't gain access to your app activity or personal information‚Äîkeeping your data safe and secure.

<h3>Eartho Architecture</h3>

<p>Eartho's system is organized into three main services, each with a unique purpose:</p>

<h4>1. Account Service</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Users log in through existing accounts (Google, Facebook, etc.) using <strong>OAuth2</strong>.</li>
  <li>Eartho then acts as an <strong>OIDC provider</strong>, offering a unified, privacy-focused login across supported apps without sharing data back to these providers.</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. MyAccount Service</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Allows users to manage their data, privacy settings, and linked accounts.</li>
  <li>Users have control over data storage, can view login history, and adjust privacy preferences.</li>
</ul>

<h4>3. Developer Service</h4>
<ul>
  <li>For developers to register their apps and integrate Eartho as a login option.</li>
  <li>Provides all setup details for easy app integration.</li>
</ul>

<p>This structure keeps each service focused: <strong>Account Service</strong> for user login, <strong>MyAccount Service</strong> for data control, and <strong>Developer Service</strong> for app integration.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

<h3>Why should I trust you?</h3>

<p>We're committed to being as transparent as possible. We use well-established, widely adopted open-source libraries that have been trusted by millions of developers. Our team has years of experience in the industry, and we‚Äôre dedicated to building a platform that puts users' privacy and security first.</p>

<p>We understand this is a new project, and we‚Äôre constantly improving. Our code is open for anyone to review, contribute to, or suggest improvements. While it‚Äôs early days for Eartho, our goal is to continually evolve and provide a safe, privacy-first solution for managing digital access.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: As this is a growing project, we‚Äôre always open to feedback and making things better over time.</p>

<h3>Who is behind Eartho?</h3>

<p>Hey! I'm Dvir Daniel, the creator of Eartho. I've been working in the IT industry for almost 10 years as a software engineer. Eartho started as my personal project with the goal to offer a privacy-first, open-source alternative to Google Sign-In. Right now, it's just me and a few friends helping out here and there. It's still early days for the project, but we‚Äôre improving it step by step and being as transparent as possible. Excited to have you join us on this journey!</p>

<h3>How is Eartho different from other authentication services like Auth0 or Keycloak?</h3>

<p>Eartho is designed with the user in mind, and not for developers, offering features like multiple identities, privacy-first payments, and the ability to plan your digital legacy. Unlike developer-focused tools, Eartho provides users with control over their access and personal data.</p>

<p>Developers add us as sign in option to their existing solution and they can can manage their users in Keycloak if they want. we are like Google/Facebook/Apple sign in</p>

<h3>Why should I trust Eartho with my data over Big Tech like Google/Facebook/Apple ?</h3>

Big Tech may collect data as part of their larger ecosystem, but for Eartho, access and privacy are our mission. While for them it's just another piece of the puzzle, for us, it‚Äôs the focus. We‚Äôre committed to being more convenient and advanced when it comes to managing access, giving you full control over your data and logins. Being open-source means transparency, and with Eartho, you always know where your information is and how it's used.
